# Missions
- Added Kul Tiras mission tree.
- Added Burning Legion mission tree.
 - Added the old Demonic Vanguard missions to this tree.
- Adjusted the Scourge mission trees:
 - The Scourge secondary tree now includes the missions from the Scourge of Lordaeron tree, allowing the player to experience the tree without needing to switch to the Scourge of Lordaeron.
 - Added "In Search of Frostmourne" to the tree, allowing the Scourge to trigger the Arthas (Valgarde) stuff without requiring Lordaeron to trigger it in their mission tree.
 - Arrival of Archimonde mission now enables the "Scourge Rebellion CB" allowing the Scourge to attack the Burning Legion in rebellion to their service.
 - Failure of Archimonde will now trigger either on the Hyjal event chain resolution, or if the Scourge attacks the Burning Legion with the "Scourge Rebellion" CB and obtains 60 warscore or more. 

# Flavour
- Added support for the Gorian Empire to have a unique form of the Old Horde government if they take control of the Old Horde faction.
- Switched the Hyjal Assault by Archimonde event chain to use the Burning Legion instead of the Demonic Vanguard tag. 

- Set the papal seat assigement to a dummy tag called Fel. This is to allow the Burning Legion to use the pope mechanics properly.

- Burning Legion can now use the Fel 'pope' actions.
- Added +2 Unholy Influence to the Burning Legion government reform.

# Invasion

  - The first siege won during wars with these casus belli will add a free core to the province.

# Burning Legion
- The Burning Legion now have an unique peace term: "Absorb into the Burning Legion"
 - This will convert the target to Fel and makes them a Demonic Vassal, which is a unique type of march.
- Changed Burning Legion/Demonic Order government:
 - Removed the Cossack buttons (fairly impotent and tied to the Demonic Host units)
 - Removed the Demonic Host special units (doesn't work well with the Teleport Army mechanic, which is central to the BL)
 - Added Raze Province mechanic.
  - Grants Devotion when used.
 - Adjusted the modifiers given by the reforms.
- Burning Legion loses devotion much quicker when at peace. This is to encourage razing (which restores devotion).
- Changed the following papal actions:
 - beckon_demonspawn -> global_manpower_modifier = 0.2
 - summon_eredar_warlocks -> missionaries = 2
 - consult_with_nathrezim -> culture_conversion_cost = -0.33
 - summon_succubi -> global_missionary_strength = 0.03
 - apply_demonic_wards -> defensiveness = 0.25

  - Increases ship capture chance and reduces sunk ship morale hit.
  
# Diplomacy
- Added "Intimidate" diplomatic action:
 - Allows savage nations to 'intimidate' civilized nations, adding a truce if successful. 
 - This allows savage nations to better control who is involved in wars, and to protect themselves if weak.
 - The success if based on the difference between both of the ruler's MIL
  - +2 towards enemy, 50% chance of success
  - +1 to -1, 75% chance of success
  - +2 towards us, 90% chance of success
  
- Added "Provoke Locals" diplomatic action:
 - Covert action: costs 50 Spy Network
